Two pointers
Two pointers is very common technique to solve array and string problems.
Two integers/pointers that move along iterable.
Move pointers until the meet.

Example problems:

Sliding Window
    Move windows with right and left index until some of the requirements are met.
    Usually you increase right index until until some requirment is not broken.
    When it is broken you, increase left window until it is fixed.
    At the end of loop of an collection you calculate based on right and left index and you have result.
    Very important!
    Usually when you want to count lenght of the subbarray in anwer you can use:
        RIGHT - LEFT + 1 !!!!!!!!
