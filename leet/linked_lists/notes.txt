To remove node from list you can simply do:
    Have a current node
    Point current.next to curent.next.next
    This way next node is skipped over

If reversing nodes is not understandable, relay to my sketchbook
    Basically you do
    Iterate until current node is NULL
    in the loop you do:
        Keep track of next node before switch
        assign next node to previous one
        previous one become current, this is needed for next iteration
        current node becomes next node I first saved
    If you do this in the middle of the linked list you will unchain list
